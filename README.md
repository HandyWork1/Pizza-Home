# Application Name
## PIZZA_HOME

#### {Brief description of application}, {Date of current version}
Pizza-Home is a pizza ordering and delivery website that I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(JQuery).

#### **{List of contributors}**
This website was created by HandyWork1.

## Description
This website utilizes Javascript to analyze user input(via check-boxes, number and text inputs, and radio buttons). The user lands on the main page designed using HTML, CSS(Bootstrap).The user can select the size of the pizza, the type of crust, types of toppings and the method of delivery based on the checkbox and radio button forms. The submit buttons at the end of each section allow the total to be updated with each selection and also alert the user accordingly of the current total amount.
